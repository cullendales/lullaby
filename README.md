# lullaby
A Firefox add-on which helps users fall asleep to boring YouTube videos. Comes with an optional cat-lock feature to keep your pesky cat from clicking keys on your nice warm keyboard when dozing off.

## About
The alpha version of the add-on will be added once available to download on Firefox. My JavaScript skills are still improving - thanks for your patience!
